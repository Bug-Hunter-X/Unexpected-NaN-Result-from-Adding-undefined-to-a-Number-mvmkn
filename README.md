# Unexpected NaN Result from Adding undefined to a Number

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in JavaScript: the unexpected result of adding 'undefined' to a number.  When you add 'undefined' to a number, the result is 'NaN' (Not a Number), which can lead to unexpected program behavior and hard-to-debug issues. 

The bug showcases this behavior. The solution shows the importance of handling undefined values explicitly for robust and predictable code.
